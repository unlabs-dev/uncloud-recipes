# uncloud-recipes

A community-maintained collection of [Compose](https://compose-spec.io/) configurations and guides for deploying popular
services on [Uncloud](https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud).

## Recipes

- [**NATS cluster**](nats/) - Deploys a [NATS](https://nats.io/) cluster, with the optional JetStream persistence layer.
- [**PostgreSQL HA with Stolon**](stolon-postgres-ha/) - Deploys a highly available PostgreSQL cluster managed by
  [Stolon](https://github.com/sorintlab/stolon).
- [**WordPress with MariaDB**](wordpress-mariadb/) - Complete WordPress site with MariaDB database backend.
- [**External services**](external-services/) - Expose services running outside of uncloud (bare-metal hosts, BMC
  controllers, smart home hubs) via the managed Caddy reverse proxy.
